# Holomorphy of `ρ_{m,x}` on the upper half-plane

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1`, `α ∈ ℚ` and `x = e(α)`. The function
`ρ_{m,x}(τ) = x^{-2} ∑_{k ≥ 0} x^{2(m+1)k} q^{(m+1)k²} g_{k,x}(q)`, `q = e(τ)`,
is holomorphic on `ℍ`.

Each summand is holomorphic on `ℍ`: `e` is entire and maps `ℍ` into the open unit disk, on
which `g_{k,x}` is holomorphic (`HigherDyson2.differentiableOn_gTail`). On a closed disk
around a point of `ℍ` and contained in `ℍ` the series has a summable majorant
(`HigherDyson2.rhoNormal_exists_majorant`), so by the Weierstrass `M`-test its sum is
holomorphic on the open disk, hence complex differentiable at its centre.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.rho_holomorphic`: `ρ_{m,x}` is complex differentiable on `ℍ`.

## Implementation notes

The source restricts to `0 ≤ α < 1`; the argument only uses `|e(α)| = 1`, valid for every
rational `α`, so no restriction on `α` is imposed.
