# Punctured slices avoid the divisor

For `0 ≤ α < 1`, `τ ∈ ℍ` and `w₀ ∈ ℂ`, there is `δ > 0` such that `(τ, w₀ + ε)` lies in
`(ℍ × ℂ) \ D_x` for every `ε` with `0 < |ε| < δ`.

If `(τ, w₀)` is off the divisor, this follows from the openness of `(ℍ × ℂ) \ D_x`. If it lies
on a component `L_{a,b}`, it lies on no other component (the imaginary part of `τ` is positive),
so it belongs to the open set `Ω_{a,b}`; a small punctured slice stays in `Ω_{a,b}` and misses
`L_{a,b}` because it moves `w` off `w₀`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.punctured_off_divisor`: punctured slices avoid the divisor.
