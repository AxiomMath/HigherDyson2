# The twisted theta sum is holomorphic

Let `m ≥ 2`, `α ∈ ℚ` with `0 ≤ α < 1`, and `x = e(α)`. The function
`(τ, w) ↦ ∑_{ℓ=0}^{2m-1} C_{m,ℓ,x}(τ) T^{[x]}_{m,ℓ}(τ, w)` is holomorphic on `ℍ × ℂ`:
each `C_{m,ℓ,x}` is holomorphic on `ℍ`, each `T^{[x]}_{m,ℓ}` is holomorphic on `ℍ × ℂ`,
and finite sums of products of holomorphic functions are holomorphic.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.differentiableOn_thetaSum`: the twisted theta sum is complex differentiable
  on `ℍ × ℂ`.
