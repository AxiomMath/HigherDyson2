# The product shift for `G_d`

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1` and `P_d(z) = 1 + z + ⋯ + z^{d-1}`. For `|q| < 1` and any `y`,
the product `G_d(y; q) = ∏_{r ≥ 1} P_d(y q^r)` satisfies the shift relation
`G_d(y; q) = P_d(y q) G_d(y q; q)`: splitting off the factor `r = 1` leaves
`∏_{r ≥ 2} P_d(y q^r) = ∏_{r ≥ 1} P_d((y q) q^r)`, which is `G_d(y q; q)`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.GProduct_eq_cyclotomicSum_mul_GProduct`: the product shift
  `G_d(y; q) = P_d(y q) G_d(y q; q)`.

## Implementation notes

The identity is obtained by peeling off the first factor of the unconditional product,
using that the shifted factors `P_d((y q) q^r)` are multipliable, rather than by passing to
the limit in the partial products.
