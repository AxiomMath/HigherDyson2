# Uniqueness of the theta coefficients

Let `m ≥ 2`, `α ∈ ℚ` with `0 ≤ α < 1` and `x = e(α)`. If functions `h'_0, …, h'_{2m-1}` on `ℍ`
satisfy `ℰ^{fin}_{m,x}(τ, w + α/m) = ∑_{ℓ=0}^{2m-1} h'_ℓ(τ) ϑ_{m,ℓ}(τ, w)` for every
`(τ, w) ∈ ℍ × ℂ` with `(τ, w + α/m) ∉ 𝒟_x`, then `h'_ℓ = h_{m,ℓ,x}` on `ℍ` for every `ℓ < 2m`.

Fix `τ ∈ ℍ` and put `Z(w) = ∑_ℓ (h'_ℓ(τ) - h_{m,ℓ,x}(τ)) ϑ_{m,ℓ}(τ, w)`. Subtracting the theta
expansion `HigherDyson2.finitePart_add_div_eq_sum_theta` from the hypothesis, `Z` vanishes off
the divisor slice. Every point has a punctured neighbourhood avoiding the slice
(`HigherDyson2.punctured_off_divisor`), and `Z` is continuous
(`HigherDyson2.differentiableOn_theta`), so `Z` vanishes identically; the linear independence
of the theta series (`HigherDyson2.theta_coeff_unique`) then forces every coefficient to vanish.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.thetaCoeffH_unique`: the theta coefficients are the unique coefficients of the
  theta expansion of the translated finite part.
