# The theta coefficients in terms of `C_{m,ℓ,x}`

For `m ≥ 2`, `x = e(α)` with `α ∈ ℚ ∩ [0, 1)`, `0 ≤ ℓ < 2m` and `τ ∈ ℍ`, the theta
coefficient factors through the coefficient `C_{m,ℓ,x}`:
`h_{m,ℓ,x}(τ) = e(ℓα/m) e(-ℓ²τ/(4m)) C_{m,ℓ,x}(τ)`.
Both sides carry the same series `x^{ℓ-2} ∑_{k ≥ 1} g_{k,x}(q) ∑_{s=1}^k …`, so the identity
is a regrouping of the prefactors.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.thetaCoeffH_eq_coeffC`: `h_{m,ℓ,x} = e(ℓα/m) e(-ℓ²τ/(4m)) C_{m,ℓ,x}`.

## Implementation notes

The identity holds for every `m`, `ℓ`, `α` and `τ`; the hypotheses of the source statement
are kept so that the statement matches it, and are not used by the proof.
