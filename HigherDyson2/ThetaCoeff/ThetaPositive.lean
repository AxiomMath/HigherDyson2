# Positivity of the theta coefficients at `x = 1`

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1`, `α = 0` (so `x = e(0) = 1`), `0 ≤ ℓ < 2m` and `t > 0`. Then the
theta coefficient `h_{m,ℓ,1}(it)` is a positive real number.

By `HigherDyson2.thetaCoeffH_eq_coeffC`,
`h_{m,ℓ,1}(it) = e(0) e(-ℓ²it/(4m)) C_{m,ℓ,1}(it)`. Here `e(0) = 1`, the factor
`e(-ℓ²it/(4m)) = exp(2πℓ²t/(4m))` is a positive real, and `C_{m,ℓ,1}(it)` is a positive real by
`HigherDyson2.coeffC_pos`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.thetaCoeffH_pos`: `0 < h_{m,ℓ,1}(it)` for real `t > 0`.

## Implementation notes

Positivity is stated with the partial order on `ℂ`, in which `0 < z` means that `z` is real
and positive.
