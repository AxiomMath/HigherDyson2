# The finite part is not identically zero

Let `m ≥ 2`, `α ∈ ℚ` with `0 ≤ α < 1` and `x = e(α)`. Then the finite part `ℰ^{fin}_{m,x}`
does not vanish identically on `(ℍ × ℂ) \ 𝒟_x`.

If it did, the zero functions `h'_ℓ = 0` would satisfy the theta expansion
`ℰ^{fin}_{m,x}(τ, w + α/m) = ∑_ℓ h'_ℓ(τ) ϑ_{m,ℓ}(τ, w)` off the divisor, so by uniqueness of
the theta coefficients (`HigherDyson2.thetaCoeffH_unique`) every `h_{m,ℓ,x}` would vanish on
`ℍ`. Taking `ℓ = 0` contradicts `HigherDyson2.exists_thetaCoeffH_ne_zero`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.exists_finitePart_ne_zero`: some value of `ℰ^{fin}_{m,x}` off the divisor is
  nonzero.
