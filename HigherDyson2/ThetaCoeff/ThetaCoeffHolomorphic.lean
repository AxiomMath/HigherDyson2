# Holomorphy of the theta coefficients `h_{m,ℓ,x}`

Let `m ≥ 2`, `x = e(α)` with `α ∈ ℚ` and `0 ≤ α < 1`, and `0 ≤ ℓ < 2m`. The theta
coefficient `h_{m,ℓ,x}` is holomorphic on the upper half-plane `ℍ`: on `ℍ` it equals
`e(ℓα/m) e(-ℓ²τ/(4m)) C_{m,ℓ,x}(τ)`, a constant times an entire function times the
holomorphic function `C_{m,ℓ,x}`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.differentiableOn_thetaCoeffH`: `h_{m,ℓ,x}` is complex differentiable on `ℍ`.
