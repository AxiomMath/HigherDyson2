# Uniform denominator bound off the divisor

Let `α ∈ ℚ` with `0 ≤ α < 1` and `x = e(α)`. On every compact subset `S` of
`(ℍ × ℂ) \ 𝒟_x` the reciprocals `|1 - x u q^j|⁻¹`, with `q = e(τ)` and `u = e(w)`, are bounded
uniformly in `(τ, w) ∈ S` and `j ∈ ℤ`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.denominator_bound`: the uniform bound above.

/-- **Uniform denominator bound off the divisor.** Let `α ∈ ℚ` with `0 ≤ α < 1` and
`x = e(α)`. For every compact `S ⊆ (ℍ × ℂ) \ 𝒟_x` there is `A > 0` with
`|1 - x u q^j|⁻¹ ≤ A` for all `(τ, w) ∈ S`, `q = e(τ)`, `u = e(w)`, and all `j ∈ ℤ`. -/
