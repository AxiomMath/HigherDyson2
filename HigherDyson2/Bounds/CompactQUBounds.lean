# Uniform bounds for `q = e(τ)` and `u = e(w)` on compact sets

For `(τ, w)` ranging over a compact subset `S` of `ℍ × ℂ`, the moduli `|q| = |e(τ)|` and
`|u| = |e(w)|` are bounded away from `0` and `∞`, and moreover `|q|` is bounded away from `1`:
there are `0 < Q₀ ≤ Q < 1` and `0 < a₀ ≤ b₀` with `Q₀ ≤ |e(τ)| ≤ Q` and `a₀ ≤ |e(w)| ≤ b₀`
on `S`.

Since `|e(z)| = exp(-2π Im z)`, both moduli are continuous and positive functions on `S`,
and the first is `< 1` on `ℍ × ℂ`. On a compact set each attains its minimum and maximum,
and the maximum of `|e(τ)|`, being attained at a point of `S ⊆ ℍ × ℂ`, is `< 1`.

## Main results
