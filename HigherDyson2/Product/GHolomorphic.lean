# Holomorphy of the tails `g_{k,x}`

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1` and `P_d(z) = 1 + z + ⋯ + z^{d-1}`. For `x ∈ ℂ` and `k ∈ ℕ` the
tail `g_{k,x}(q) = ∏_{r ≥ 1} P_d(x q^k q^r)` is holomorphic on the open unit disk.

On a disk `|q| < Q` with `Q < 1`, the point `y = x q^k` satisfies `|y| ≤ |x|`, so the
factors are uniformly within a summable bound `M_r` of `1`. By the Weierstrass criterion
for products the partial products, which are polynomials in `q`, converge locally
uniformly to `g_{k,x}`, and a locally uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.differentiableOn_gTail`: `g_{k,x}` is complex differentiable on the open
  unit disk.
