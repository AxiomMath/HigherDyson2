# A uniform bound on the tails `g_{k,x}`

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1`, and let `g_{k,x}(q) = G_d(x q^k; q)` be the tails of the product
`G_d(y; q) = ∏_{r ≥ 1} P_d(y q^r)`. For `0 ≤ Q < 1` and `B ≥ 0` the tails are bounded
uniformly in `k ∈ ℕ`, `|q| ≤ Q` and `|x| ≤ B`.

Indeed, with `y = x q^k` one has `|y| ≤ B Q^k ≤ B`, so the factors `1 + a_r = P_d(y q^r)`
satisfy `|a_r| ≤ M_r` for the summable sequence `M_r` of the uniform factor bound, and the
estimate `|∏ (1 + a_r) - 1| ≤ exp (∑ |a_r|) - 1` gives `|g_{k,x}(q)| ≤ exp (∑ M_r)`.
