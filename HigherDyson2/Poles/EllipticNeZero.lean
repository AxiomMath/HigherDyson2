# The periodization is not identically zero

Let `m ≥ 2`, `α ∈ ℚ` with `0 ≤ α < 1` and `x = e(α)`. Then the periodization `ℰ_{m,x}` does
not vanish identically on `(ℍ × ℂ) \ 𝒟_x`.

Near the cusp, `ρ_{m,x}(τ) = x⁻² + O(|e(τ)|)` (`HigherDyson2.rho_leading`) and `|x⁻²| = 1`, so
`ρ_{m,x}(it) ≠ 0` for `t` large. At such `τ₀ = it` the point `w = -α` is a genuine pole of
`ℰ_{m,x}(τ₀, ·)` (`HigherDyson2.periodization_pole_genuine`): `ε ℰ_{m,x}(τ₀, -α + ε)` tends to
a nonzero limit. Since a punctured disc about `-α` avoids the divisor
(`HigherDyson2.punctured_off_divisor`), the periodization cannot vanish on all of
`(ℍ × ℂ) \ 𝒟_x`, for then that limit would be `0`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.periodization_ne_zero`: some `(τ, w) ∈ (ℍ × ℂ) \ 𝒟_x` has
  `ℰ_{m,x}(τ, w) ≠ 0`.
