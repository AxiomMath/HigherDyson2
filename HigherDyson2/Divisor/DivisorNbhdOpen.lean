# The neighbourhood of one divisor component is open

For `a, b ∈ ℤ`, the set `Ω_{a,b} = (ℍ × ℂ) \ ⋃_{(c, d) ≠ (a, b)} L_{c,d}` is open in `ℂ × ℂ`.
Around a point `p ∈ Ω_{a,b}` take a closed ball `B ⊆ ℍ × ℂ`; it is compact, so by local
finiteness only finitely many components `L_{c,d}` meet it. Removing from the open ball the
finitely many closed lines `w = -α + c τ + d` through those components (none of which contains
`p`) leaves an open neighbourhood of `p` inside `Ω_{a,b}`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.divisorNbhd_isOpen`: `divisorNbhd α a b` is open.
