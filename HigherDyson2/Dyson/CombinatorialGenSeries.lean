# The generating function of the full rank

For `m ≥ 1`, `N ∈ ℕ` and `r ∈ ℤ`, the coefficient `[z^r] [q^N] R_m(z;q)` is the number
`N_m(r, N)` of `m`-Dyson symbols of size `N` and full rank `r`.

Only the terms `𝒯_{m,n}` with `n ≤ N` contribute to `[q^N] R_m`, since `[q^N] 𝒯_{m,n} = 0`
for `N < n²`. The coefficient `[z^r] [q^N] 𝒯_{m,n}` counts the symbols with square `n`, size
`N` and full rank `r`, and summing over `n ≤ N` counts all symbols of size `N` and full rank
`r`, each of which has square at most `N`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.RSeries_zCoeff_qCoeff`: `[z^r] [q^N] R_m(z;q) = N_m(r, N)`.
