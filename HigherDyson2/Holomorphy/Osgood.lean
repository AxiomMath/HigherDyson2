# Osgood's lemma in two variables

Let `U ⊆ ℂ × ℂ` be open and let `f : ℂ × ℂ → ℂ` be continuous on `U` and holomorphic in each
variable separately. Then `f` is jointly complex differentiable on `U`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.osgood`: a continuous, separately holomorphic function on an open subset of
  `ℂ × ℂ` is complex differentiable there.

## Implementation notes

The usual proof expands `f` as a double power series through a double Cauchy integral. We argue
instead directly with the derivative. At `(τ, w) ∈ U`, with `a` and `b` the two partial
derivatives, write
`f (τ + h, w + k) - f (τ, w) - a h - b k = [ψₕ (w + k) - ψₕ w] + [f (τ, w + k) - f (τ, w) - b k]
  + [f (τ + h, w) - f (τ, w) - a h]`, where `ψₕ z = f (τ + h, z) - f (τ, z)`.
The last two brackets are `o(‖(h, k)‖)` by separate differentiability. On a closed polydisc of
radius `r` about `(τ, w)` contained in `U`, uniform continuity of `f` makes `sup ‖ψₕ‖` small with
`h`; the Cauchy estimate on discs of radius `r / 2` then bounds `‖ψₕ'‖` on the disc of radius
`r / 2` about `w`, and the mean value inequality bounds the first bracket by a small multiple
of `‖k‖`.
