# Normally convergent series of holomorphic functions on `ℂ × ℂ`

Let `U ⊆ ℂ × ℂ` be open and let `(f i)` be holomorphic on `U`, with the series of the suprema
of `‖f i‖` over every compact subset of `U` summable. Then `p ↦ ∑' i, f i p` is holomorphic on
`U`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.differentiableOn_tsum_of_normal`: a normally convergent series of holomorphic
  functions on an open subset of `ℂ × ℂ` is holomorphic.

## Implementation notes

Normal convergence on compact subsets is stated as: every compact `K ⊆ U` admits a summable
majorant `u` with `‖f i p‖ ≤ u i` for `p ∈ K`. This is the summability of the suprema, and no
countability of the index set is needed. The proof works on an open ball whose closure lies in
`U`: there the series is continuous and holomorphic in each variable by the one-variable
results of Mathlib, and Osgood's lemma `HigherDyson2.osgood` gives joint holomorphy.
