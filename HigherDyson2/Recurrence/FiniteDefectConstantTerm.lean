# The constant term of the defect polynomial

Let `m ≥ 2` and `d = 2m + 1`. The constant term of the defect polynomial `R_{d,x}(U;q)` is
`-X₀^{(m)}(x;q)`. This is the case `a = 0` of the coefficient formula for `defectPoly`: since
`d - 3 ≥ 2` and `d - 2 ≥ 3`, both Kronecker deltas vanish, and the remaining sum
`∑_{k=0}^{0} x^k X_k` is `X₀`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.defectPoly_coeff_zero`: `[U⁰] R_{d,x}(U;q) = -X₀^{(m)}(x;q)`.
