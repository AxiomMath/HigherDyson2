# The degree of the defect polynomial

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1`, `x ∈ ℂˣ` and `0 < |q| < 1`. The defect polynomial `R_{d,x}(U;q)`
is a linear combination of the monomials `U^{d-3}`, `U^{d-2}` and `U^a` with `0 ≤ a ≤ d - 2`,
so its degree is at most `d - 2`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.defectPoly_degree_le`: `deg R_{d,x}(U;q) ≤ d - 2`.

## Implementation notes

The argument only uses the shape of `R_{d,x}`: every monomial occurring in it has exponent
at most `d - 2`, so `R_{d,x}` lies in the submodule `Polynomial.degreeLE ℂ (d - 2)`. The
hypotheses `2 ≤ m`, `x ≠ 0` and `0 < |q| < 1` are those of the source and are kept in the
statement, although the bound holds for all `m`, `x` and `q`.
