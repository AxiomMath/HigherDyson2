# Vanishing of `C_x` at nontrivial `d`-th roots of unity

Let `m ≥ 2` and `d = 2m + 1`. The finite constant `C_x = ∑_{r=0}^{d-1} x^r` vanishes
whenever `x` is a `d`-th root of unity other than `1`: multiplying by `1 - x` telescopes the
sum to `1 - x^d = 0`, and `1 - x ≠ 0`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.Cx_eq_zero_of_pow_eq_one`: `C_x = 0` for `x ≠ 1` with `x ^ (2m+1) = 1`.

## Implementation notes

The hypothesis `2 ≤ m` is that of the source and is kept in the statement, although the
geometric-sum argument only uses `x ≠ 1` and `x ^ (2m+1) = 1`.
