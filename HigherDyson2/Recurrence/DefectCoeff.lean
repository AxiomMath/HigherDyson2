# Coefficients of the defect polynomial

Let `m ≥ 2` and `d = 2m + 1`. For `0 ≤ a ≤ d - 2`, the coefficient of `U^a` in the defect
polynomial `R_{d,x}(U;q)` is
`δ_{a,d-3} q⁻¹ x⁻² X₀ + δ_{a,d-2} x⁻¹ X₁ - ∑_{k=0}^{a} x^k X_k`.
The two monomials contribute the Kronecker deltas, and the inner sum `∑_{a'=k}^{d-2} U^{a'}`
of the double sum contains `U^a`, with coefficient `1`, exactly when `k ≤ a`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.defectPoly_coeff`: the coefficient formula for `defectPoly`.

## Implementation notes

The hypotheses `2 ≤ m`, `x ≠ 0` and `0 < ‖q‖ < 1` are those of the source and are kept in
the statement; the computation is purely formal and uses only `a ≤ d - 2`.
