# Absolute convergence of the seed series

Let `m ≥ 2`, `d = 2m + 1`, and let `g_{k,x}(q) = G_d(x q^k; q)` be the tails of the product
`G_d`. For `x, u ∈ ℂ` and `0 < |q| < 1` the series
`∑_{k ≥ 0} q^{k²} g_{k,x}(q) / (1 - x u q^k)` defining `seed m x u q` converges absolutely.

Since `|q| < 1`, the denominators `1 - x u q^k` tend to `1`, so their inverses form a bounded
sequence; the summands are therefore dominated by a constant multiple of the absolutely
summable terms `q^{k²} g_{k,x}(q)` of `X_0(x; q)`.

## Main results

* `HigherDyson2.summable_norm_seed_term`: the summands of `seed` are absolutely summable.

## Implementation notes

The hypothesis `x u q^k ≠ 1` for all `k` is not needed: division by zero is zero in Lean, so a
vanishing denominator only replaces a summand by `0`, and the inverses `(1 - x u q^k)⁻¹` remain a
bounded sequence regardless.
